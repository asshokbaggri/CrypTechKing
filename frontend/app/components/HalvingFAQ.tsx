        <h3>When is the next Bitcoin halving?</h3>
        <p>
          The next Bitcoin halving is expected around April 2028, depending on
          how quickly new blocks are mined.
        </p>

        <h3>Does Bitcoin price increase immediately after halving?</h3>
        <p>
          Historically, Bitcoin price does not surge immediately. Bull cycles
          often occur months after a halving due to reduced supply.
        </p>

        <h3>Why does Bitcoin halving exist?</h3>
        <p>
          Halving controls inflation and ensures Bitcoin’s total supply never
          exceeds 21 million coins.
        </p>

        <h3>Can Bitcoin halving be changed or stopped?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Bitcoin halving is enforced by code and cannot be altered without
          global network consensus.
